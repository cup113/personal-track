 * The plugin's route table: the one place `/habit/api` is declared.

 * JSON and the URL are the real interface between the two halves — and until
 * now each half spelled that interface out for itself, so the host's route
 * keys and the browser's fetch paths could drift with nothing to catch it. This
 * module is the single declaration: the host mounts a handler per entry, the
 * browser builds its requests from the same entries, and a test asserts the two
 * agree.
 *
 * It is isomorphic on purpose — plain data and one pure function, no `node:`
 * imports, no DOM — so the browser bundle can inline it.
