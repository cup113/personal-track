/**
 * The day as Markdown — what the 复制纯文本报告 button puts on the clipboard.
 *
 * One line per board group (日常 / 饮食 / 学习 / 健身), with 任务 closing the
 * report as a Markdown list, so a report reads top to bottom the way the board
 * does.
 *
 * **Completeness first**: the report is the whole day, not a digest of it, so
 * nothing the board shows is dropped for the sake of brevity. Every meal slot
 * appears with its own price, every set of a timed exercise appears with its
 * own seconds, equipment keeps its weight, and a group with nothing in it keeps
 * its line (`健身 —`) instead of vanishing into a gap the reader cannot tell
 * apart from "not recorded". This is display formatting of a slice the host
 * already sent: no extra reads and no truth of its own — every figure is one
 * the board is already showing for the same day.
 *
 * Tasks are the one cross-day registry that appears, and they appear as what is
 * still **remaining**: every unfinished task, whatever its deadline — the day
 * it is due, a later one, or none — each at its *current* progress and in the
 * board's own order. Finished tasks are not remaining, so the list does not
 * carry them.
